# ðŸ§ª Survey App â€“ Frontend Assessment

This is a lightweight, responsive survey application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite** as part of a frontend technical assessment for Derilinx.

The app allows users to:
- View a list of surveys
- Answer surveys dynamically (single or multiple choice)
- Submit responses
- View a clear summary of submitted answers
